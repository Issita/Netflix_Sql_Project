## Overview
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my Netflix SQL Analysis project.

In this project, Iâ€™ve taken a deep dive into Netflixâ€™s massive catalog of movies and TV shows using SQL Server. The idea was simple â€” treat the dataset like a treasure chest of stories and see what we can learn from it. Whether it's figuring out what kind of content dominates the platform, which countries produce the most, or spotting patterns in ratings, I wanted to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

Think of this as a behind-the-scenes look at the world of Netflix â€” powered by SQL queries!
